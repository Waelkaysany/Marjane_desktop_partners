# Marjane Desktop – Partner Platform  
Stage d’initiation Project

This project is a **desktop-style web application** developed during my **stage d’initiation at Marjane**.  
It is designed for **Marjane partner stores**, giving them a centralized digital workspace where they can access all the products, tools, and information they need to work with Marjane.

---

## Project Idea

Marjane is building a **network of local partner stores**.  
Each partner receives access to a **Marjane Desktop**, which acts like a **digital control center** for their shop.

This desktop allows partners to:
- View Marjane products
- Discover recommended and strategic products
- Manage what they need to sell
- Stay connected to the Marjane ecosystem

Instead of using many separate tools, everything is gathered in **one simple and powerful interface**.

---

## Goal of the Project

The main objective is to create a **digital workspace** for Marjane partners that:

- Makes product discovery easier  
- Helps partners choose the right products  
- Improves collaboration between Marjane and local stores  
- Gives small shops access to the power of a big brand  

This turns Marjane into a **platform**, not just a supermarket.

## Products & Recommendations

A key part of the project is the **Recommended Products page**.

Finding and selecting these products was a real challenge:
- Products were chosen based on availability, quality, and market relevance  
- Many products were hard to find  
- Each one was selected carefully to match Marjane’s strategy  

This makes the recommendation system realistic and useful for real partner stores.

## Design & User Experience

The desktop was designed to feel:
- Clean  
- Professional  
- Easy to use  
- Modern  

The interface allows partners to quickly find what they need without confusion.

## Animations & Interactions (GSAP)

The project uses **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** to add:

- Smooth transitions  
- Animated elements  
- Dynamic page changes  
- A fluid desktop experience  

These animations make the platform feel **alive** and **premium**, not static.

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- GSAP (for animations and interactions)

---

## Project Type

This is not a simple website.  
It is a **desktop-style platform** built to support:
- Partner stores  
- Product discovery  
- Digital collaboration  

It represents how Marjane can manage a **large network of local partners** through technology.
